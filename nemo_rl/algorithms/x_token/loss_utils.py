"""Shared utilities for cross-tokenizer distillation.

Hosts pieces that are used by both :mod:`token_aligner` (in this package)
and :mod:`nemo_rl.algorithms.loss.loss_functions`:

    - :class:`Fp32SparseMM` — FP32 sparse-dense matmul autograd Function
      that ignores the surrounding BF16 autocast (PyTorch has no BF16
      sparse-mm kernel).
    - :func:`chunk_average_log_probs`, :func:`valid_chunk_mask` —
      chunk-aggregation helpers for the cross-tokenizer KL paths.
    - :func:`parse_projection_file` — single source of truth for
      reading the on-disk projection matrix file (both the dense top-k
      format and the sparse ``dict[(s, t)] -> count`` format) into COO
      components. Callers retain their own validation / sizing rules.
    - :func:`get_sparse_projection_matrix`, :func:`get_topk_projection`
      — process-local lazy caches for the materialized projection
      matrix on a given device. Driver processes never trigger a fill;
      each Ray worker populates its own cache on the first loss call.
    - :func:`build_exact_token_map` — derived common/uncommon vocab
      partition for the gold-loss path. Cached per
      ``(path, device, xtoken_loss, teacher_vocab_size)`` because the
      partition depends on those four inputs.
    - :func:`alignment_from_flat_batch` — rehydrate the flat
      ``alignment_*`` transport keys on the loss data dict into a single
      :class:`AlignmentBatch` so the loss bodies access alignment via
      attributes instead of repeating flat field names.
